## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/publication_sp500_pred.git
   cd publication_sp500_pred
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebooks in the following order:
   - `data_extraction.ipynb`
   - `data_processing.ipynb`
   - `news_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`
   - Choose a model notebook (e.g., `lstm.ipynb`, `xgboost.ipynb`)

## Results

Final evaluation metrics and prediction plots are saved in the `results/` directory. Each model includes performance metrics such as RMSE and directional accuracy.
